# TO-DO

Issue with value disparity in the Bamboo Canes 10ft group. The values for the first item are:

Profit (£): 20.24
Profit %:   29.77

However, the values in the Edit view change to the following when New Price box loses focus:

Profit (£): 5.96
Profit %:   8.77

Note that this doesn't affect other groups.


INFO:
It appears to be using a different value for postage: 24.299999999999997 instead of 10.02
